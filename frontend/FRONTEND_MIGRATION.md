# Frontend Migration: React + Vite + MobX

## Migration Complete! 🎉

The frontend has been successfully migrated from plain HTML/JavaScript to a modern React + Vite + MobX stack.

## Architecture

### 📁 Structure
```
src/
├── stores/
│   └── WebSocketStore.js          # MobX store for WebSocket state management
├── components/
│   ├── DiscoveredClients.jsx      # Shows discovered Sparkles clients
│   ├── ActiveConnections.jsx      # Shows active connections with stats & timestamps
│   ├── EventsVisualization.jsx    # Renders events timeline
│   ├── ConnectionStatus.jsx       # Connection status indicator
│   └── index.js                   # Exports for clean imports
├── App.jsx                        # Main application component
├── App.css                        # App-specific styles (minimal)
└── index.css                      # Global styles with Inter font
```

### 🔄 WebSocket Management

**Clean Reconnection Logic:**
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection state management through MobX observables  
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Visual connection status indicator

**State Management:**
- All WebSocket state managed in a single MobX store
- Reactive UI updates when data changes
- Centralized message handling and data parsing

### 🎨 Features Preserved

✅ **All original functionality maintained:**
- Discovered clients display with connect buttons
- Active connections with event stats
- Real-time timestamp display (Start/End/Current) with soft pink badges
- Event visualization with color-coded timeline
- WebSocket reconnection with visual feedback

✅ **Enhanced with React benefits:**
- Component-based architecture
- Reactive state management with MobX
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Modern build system with Vite

### 🚀 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Clean Component Architecture**: Each UI section is now a separate, reusable component
2. **Robust WebSocket Handling**: Automatic reconnection with proper state management
3. **Modern Styling**: Inter font integration with clean, responsive design
4. **Type Safety Ready**: Structure prepared for TypeScript migration if needed
5. **Performance**: Vite build system for fast development and optimized production builds

The migration maintains 100% feature parity while providing a much more maintainable and scalable codebase!
